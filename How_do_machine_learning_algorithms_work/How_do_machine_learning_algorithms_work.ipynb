    "### Learning a Function To Make Predictions\n",

    "\n",
    "This is called predictive modeling or predictive analytics and our goal is to make the most accurate predictions possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we are not really interested in the shape and form of the function (f) that we are learning, only that it makes accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could learn the mapping of Y=f(X) to learn more about the relationship in the data and this is called statistical inference. If this were the goal, we would use simpler methods and value understanding the learned model and form of (f) above making accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we learn a function (f) we are estimating its form from the data that we have available. As such, this estimate will have error. It will not be a perfect estimate for the underlying hypothetical best mapping from Y given X.\n",
